# polecalc

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

Made in a couple hours for demo purposes, developed on the web platform issues so far:
- Prints FP no's not fractional numbers
- More foolproofing
- Can't detect Keypresses
- Add more functions like trigo.

Uses RPN (Reverse Polish Notation) or infix notation where the operation is followed by its arguments, eg:
```
1 + (2 / 3)

in infix

+ 1 / 2 3
```

To end one argument and move to the next one, use `SPC`
